## Homework Reflection

## Steps

  1. I created a new repository on Github
  2. I created an R studio project and copied the link from my Github repository into the version control tab when I was creating      the new project
  3. I went into the README.md file on R studio and made these edits, using Jenny Bryan's sample document as a template
  4. I saved, then committed, pulled and then pushed to github :thumbsup:
  5. I moved the gapminder .rmb and .md files into my project folder using my local directory 
  6. I opened the gapminder files in R studio, committed them, (pulled) and pushed to github
  
## Issues
  - I can't get my gif to show up in github. If you look at the raw for this file you can see the link is there and I don't think     there any any errors with my syntax.. Can somebody help?
